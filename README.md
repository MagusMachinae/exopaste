# exopaste

Fork of the exopaste demo application from https://www.exoscale.com/syslog/clojure-application-tutorial/

Demonstration of Fullstack Clojure development techniques. Stack components implemented with the following libraries:

### Aleph : Webserver

High performance webserver and HTTP client.

### Bidi : Routing Library

Bi-directional routing library for Clojure and Clojurescript. Implements routes as data structures, resulting in greater ease of use and reliability.

### Component : Dependency Injection

Employed to allow modular construction for simpler extensibility.

### Hiccup : HTML templating

HTML renderer and library for implementing HTML elements as Clojure data structures. Allows view code to be programmatically generated and easily manipulated and composed with Clojure tools and procedures.

## Installation

Ensure Clojure and Leiningen are installed.

Call `lein run` from inside the project folder.

The application will start a server listening on localhost port :8080, so simply enter http://localhost:8080 into your browser, or click the above link once the server has been started.
